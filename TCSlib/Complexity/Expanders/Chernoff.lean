# The Expander Chernoff Bound

Arora–Barak's Theorem 7.41: the fraction of time a random walk on an expander
spends inside a set `B` of density `β` concentrates around `β`, with the same
exponential decay (up to the spectral gap factor `1−λ`) as for independent
samples.  This is the tool behind randomness-efficient error reduction for
*two-sided* error algorithms (run the algorithm on the `k` coin strings
visited by a walk and take the majority).

## Main results (sorry-stubbed)

* `Expander.walk_visits_concentration` — [AB09, Thm 7.41].

## Deviations from the source

* As in `Expanders.Walks`, our walk `walkPMF hA k` visits `k+1` vertices
  (the book's `X₁,…,X_k` has `k` vertices), so `k+1` replaces the book's `k`.
* **Erratum.** The draft prints the bound as `2e^{(1−λ)δ²k/60}`, with a
  positive exponent, which is vacuous; the intended bound (cf. Gillman,
  *A Chernoff bound for random walks on expander graphs*, SIAM J. Comput.
  1998) is `2e^{−(1−λ)δ²k/60}`.  We state it with the negative exponent.
* The book's proof is omitted ("whose proof we omit"), so the eventual proof
  here will follow an external source rather than [AB09].

/-- **Expander Chernoff Bound** ([AB09, Thm 7.41]).  Let `A` be symmetric
stochastic with `λ(A) ≤ λ` (for a graph: an `(N,d,λ)`-graph) and `B` a set of
exactly `βN` vertices.  For a uniformly-started `k`-step random walk visiting
`X₀, …, X_k`, let `Bᵢ` be the indicator that `Xᵢ ∈ B`.  Then for every
`δ > 0`,

`Pr[ |(Σᵢ Bᵢ)/(k+1) − β| > δ ] < 2·exp(−(1−λ)δ²(k+1)/60)`.

The draft's positive exponent is a typo; see the module docstring.

**Proof sketch** (omitted in [AB09]; after [Gil98]): bound the moment
generating function `E[exp(t·Σᵢ Bᵢ)]` by the largest eigenvalue of the
perturbed transition operator `A·exp(t·B̂)`, control that eigenvalue via the
spectral gap `1−λ` using first-order perturbation theory, and conclude by the
exponential Markov inequality applied to both tails. -/

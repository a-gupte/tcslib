# Expander walks

Random walks driven by a symmetric stochastic matrix, and Arora–Barak's
Theorem 7.38: a random walk on an expander escapes any small vertex set with
probability exponentially close to one.

## Main definitions

* `Expander.unifMatrix` — the matrix `J` with all entries `1/n`.
* `Expander.stepPMF` — one step of the walk from a vertex, as a `PMF`.
* `Expander.walkPMF` — the `k`-step random walk started uniformly, as a `PMF`
  on `Fin (k+1) → Fin n` (a sequence of `k+1` visited vertices).

## Main results (sorry-stubbed)

* `Expander.opNorm_le_one` — a symmetric stochastic matrix has `L²` operator
  norm at most `1` ([AB09, after Def 7.39], via [AB09, Exercise 10]).
* `Expander.exists_decomposition` — `A = (1−λ)J + λC` with `‖C‖ ≤ 1`
  ([AB09, Lem 7.40]).
* `Expander.walk_all_mem_le` — the expander-walk bound [AB09, Thm 7.38].

## Deviations from the source

* [AB09, Def 7.39] defines the matrix norm as "the maximum `α` such that
  `‖A𝐯‖₂ ≤ α‖𝐯‖₂` for every `𝐯`" (i.e. the minimum such bound); we use
  Mathlib's `L²` operator norm of the associated continuous linear map, which
  is that quantity.
* [AB09, Thm 7.38] speaks of a `(k−1)`-step walk `X₁,…,X_k` on an
  `(N,d,λ)`-graph and bounds `Pr[∀ i ≤ k, X_i ∈ B] ≤ ((1−λ)√β + λ)^{k−1}`.
  We index by the number of *steps* `k`, so the walk visits `k+1` vertices
  and the bound's exponent is `k`.  As in `Expanders.Basic`, the graph is
  represented by its normalized adjacency matrix, and the eigenvalue bound
  `λ(G) ≤ λ` is a hypothesis `lambda A ≤ lam`; the set-size bound `|B| ≤ βN`
  is the hypothesis `hB`.

/-- A symmetric stochastic matrix has `L²` operator norm at most `1`.
[AB09, remark after Def 7.39: "if `A` is a normalized adjacency matrix then
`‖A‖ = 1`"]; the inequality is [AB09, Exercise 10].

**Proof sketch.** For a unit vector `𝐯`, expand `‖A𝐯‖₂²` and apply
Cauchy–Schwarz with the weights `Aᵢⱼ` in each coordinate, using that every
row and every column of `A` sums to one. -/

/-- **Decomposition of an expander step.**  If `A` is symmetric stochastic and
`λ(A) ≤ λ < 1` with `λ > 0`, then `A = (1−λ)J + λC` where `J` is the
all-`1/n` matrix and `‖C‖ ≤ 1`: a step of the walk behaves, for the purposes
of `L²` analysis, like moving to the uniform distribution with probability
`1−λ`.  (`C` may have negative entries, so this is not a literal convex
combination of walks.)  [AB09, Lem 7.40]

**Proof sketch.** Define `C = (1/λ)(A − (1−λ)J)`.  Decompose any `𝐯` as
`𝐮 + 𝐰` with `𝐮 = α𝟙` and `𝐰 ⊥ 𝟙`.  Then `C𝐮 = 𝐮` (both `A` and `J` fix
`𝟙`), and `C𝐰 = (1/λ)A𝐰` (as `J𝐰 = 0`), which has norm at most `‖𝐰‖₂` by the
defining property of `λ`.  Since `C𝐮 = 𝐮 ⊥ C𝐰 ∈ 𝟙^⊥`, Pythagoras gives
`‖C𝐯‖₂ ≤ ‖𝐯‖₂`. -/

/-- **Expander walks** ([AB09, Thm 7.38]).  Let `A` be symmetric stochastic
with `λ(A) ≤ λ` (for a graph: an `(N,d,λ)`-graph), and let `B` be a set of at
most `βN` vertices.  The probability that a uniformly-started `k`-step random
walk stays inside `B` for all of its `k+1` visited vertices is at most
`((1−λ)√β + λ)^k`.

(The book's statement, with `k` visited vertices, has exponent `k−1`; note
that if `λ, β < 1` are constants then so is `(1−λ)√β + λ`.)

**Proof sketch.** With `B̂` the diagonal projection that zeroes coordinates
outside `B`, the probability equals `|(B̂A)^k B̂𝟙|₁`.  By Lemma 7.40,
`B̂A = B̂((1−λ)J + λC)`, so `‖B̂A‖ ≤ (1−λ)‖B̂J‖ + λ‖B̂C‖ ≤ (1−λ)√β + λ`,
since `J`'s image consists of uniform vectors of which `B̂` keeps a
`β`-fraction of coordinates, and `‖B̂‖, ‖C‖ ≤ 1`.  As `‖B̂𝟙‖₂ = √β/√N`, we
get `‖(B̂A)^k B̂𝟙‖₂ ≤ ((1−λ)√β + λ)^k √β/√N`, and `|𝐯|₁ ≤ √N ‖𝐯‖₂`
(Note 7.24) concludes, dropping the extra factor `√β ≤ 1`. -/

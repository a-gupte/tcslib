# Symmetric stochastic matrices and the parameter λ

The linear-algebraic foundations of Arora–Barak's appendix 7.A: probability
distributions on vertices as vectors, the normalized adjacency matrix of a
regular graph as a symmetric stochastic matrix, and the parameter `λ(A)` —
the maximum stretch of `A` on the space orthogonal to the uniform
distribution ([AB09, Def 7.25]).

## Main definitions

* `Expander.IsSymmStochastic` — a real square matrix that is symmetric, entrywise
  nonnegative, with every row summing to `1` ([AB09, §7.A.1]).
* `Expander.uniform` — the uniform distribution `(1/n, …, 1/n)` as a vector.
* `Expander.lambda` — the parameter `λ(A)` [AB09, Def 7.25].

## Main results (sorry-stubbed)

* `Expander.lambda_nonneg`, `Expander.lambda_le_one` — `0 ≤ λ(A) ≤ 1`
  ([AB09, Rmk 7.26], via Exercise 10).
* `Expander.norm_mulVec_le_lambda` — the defining inequality
  `‖A𝐯‖₂ ≤ λ(A)‖𝐯‖₂` for `𝐯 ⊥ 1`.
* `Expander.mulVec_uniform` — `A·1 = 1`: the uniform distribution is stable.

## Deviation from the source

[AB09, §7.A] states these notions for the normalized adjacency matrix of a
`d`-regular `n`-vertex multigraph, remarking that any such matrix is symmetric
stochastic and that the definitions only use that structure.  We take the
symmetric stochastic matrix itself as the primitive object, so every result
applies to a regular multigraph via its normalized adjacency matrix; no graph
type is fixed at this layer.  `λ` is defined by a supremum over the unit
sphere of `1^⊥`, which for `n ≤ 1` is empty; `sSup ∅ = 0` makes `λ = 0` there,
consistent with the convention that a one-vertex graph is a perfect expander.

/-- A real square matrix is *symmetric stochastic* when it is symmetric,
entrywise nonnegative, and every row sums to `1` (hence, by symmetry, every
column does too).  The normalized adjacency matrix `A(G)` of any `d`-regular
multigraph is of this form.  [AB09, §7.A.1] -/

/-- The parameter `λ(A)`, also written `λ(G)` for the normalized adjacency
matrix of a graph `G`: the maximum of `‖A𝐯‖₂` over all unit vectors `𝐯`
orthogonal to the uniform distribution.  For a symmetric stochastic matrix
this equals the second largest absolute value of an eigenvalue, and `1 - λ(A)`
is the *spectral gap*.  [AB09, Def 7.25] -/

[AB09, Rmk 7.26: "`A`**1** `=` **1**"]

sums to one. -/

unfolded as used in the proof of [AB09, Lem 7.27].

**Proof sketch.** For `𝐯 = 0` both sides vanish.  Otherwise `𝐯/‖𝐯‖₂` lies in
the unit sphere of `𝟙^⊥`, so `‖A(𝐯/‖𝐯‖₂)‖₂` is one of the values whose
supremum is `λ(A)`; the supremum is attained/bounded because the sphere is
compact and `v ↦ ‖A𝐯‖₂` is continuous.  Multiply through by `‖𝐯‖₂`. -/

/-- `λ(A) ≥ 0` (for `n ≥ 2`; for `n ≤ 1` the defining set is empty and
`λ(A) = 0` by convention).  [AB09, Rmk 7.26]

**Proof sketch.** `λ` is a supremum of norms, which are nonnegative; for
`n ≥ 2` the unit sphere of `𝟙^⊥` is nonempty, so the supremum dominates one
such norm. -/

/-- Every eigenvalue of a symmetric stochastic matrix has absolute value at
most one; consequently `λ(A) ≤ 1`.  [AB09, Rmk 7.26], proved as
[AB09, Exercise 10].

**Proof sketch.** A symmetric stochastic matrix has `L²` operator norm at most
`1`: for any `𝐯`, `(A𝐯)ᵢ² = (Σⱼ Aᵢⱼ𝐯ⱼ)² ≤ Σⱼ Aᵢⱼ𝐯ⱼ²` by Cauchy–Schwarz with
weights `Aᵢⱼ` (rows sum to one), and summing over `i` uses that columns sum to
one.  The supremum defining `λ` runs over unit vectors, so it is bounded by
the operator norm. -/

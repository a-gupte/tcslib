# Closure properties of `P`

The class `P` [AB09, Def 1.13] is closed under polynomial-time preimages (many-one
reductions), under the Boolean operations, and hence under Boolean functions of finitely
many tests. These facts are used tacitly throughout [AB09] (e.g. ch. 2, ch. 5, ch. 6); here
they are derived from the function class FP (`TCSlib.Complexity.ClassNP.PolyTimePairing`)
and the closure under complement (`Complexity.compl_mem_P`, `ClassNP/CoNP.lean`).

## Main definitions

None — this module only proves theorems about existing definitions.

## Main results

* `Complexity.mem_P_iff_polyTimeComputable` — `V ∈ P` iff its one-bit indicator is in FP;
  `Complexity.mem_P_of_test`, `Complexity.test_of_mem_P` — the same for Boolean tests.
* `Complexity.preimage_mem_P` — `P` is closed under polynomial-time preimages.
* `Complexity.inter_mem_P`, `Complexity.union_mem_P`, `Complexity.empty_mem_P`,
  `Complexity.univ_mem_P` — Boolean closure.
* `Complexity.mem_P_of_atoms` — `P` is closed under Boolean functions of finitely many
  tests.
* `Complexity.lenEq_mem_P`, `lenLe_mem_P`, `lenEq_preimage_mem_P`, `lenLe_preimage_mem_P`
  — length comparisons are in `P`.
* `Complexity.mem_P_of_blockAny`, `Complexity.mem_P_of_blockMajority`,
  `Complexity.mem_P_of_blockXorAny` — `P` is closed under running a `P`-decider on
  polynomially many polynomial-length blocks of the input and aggregating the answers
  (OR / strict majority / XOR-then-OR), the folklore repetition closures used tacitly
  by [AB09] ch. 7 (Theorems 7.8, 7.10, 7.17, 7.18); the machine engine is
  `TCSlib.Complexity.ClassNP.PolyTimeBlockLoop`.

/-! ### Block-query closure

`P` is closed under running a `P`-decider on polynomially many fixed-size blocks of
the second component of a pair and aggregating the answers.  `blockAt a k z i` is the
`i`-th length-`a·(n+1)^k` block of `pairSndD z`, with `n = |pairFstD z|`; the block
count is `a'·(n+1)^k'`.  These are the folklore "repeat the machine polynomially many
times" closures that [AB09] ch. 7 uses tacitly (§7.3, Theorem 7.8; §7.4.1;
Theorems 7.17–7.18); the machine-level loop lives in
`TCSlib.Complexity.ClassNP.PolyTimeBlockLoop`.

Like `Complexity.lenEq_mem_P` above, all three sets are **total extensions through
the default projections**: `pairFstD`/`pairSndD` return `[]` on malformed words, so
a malformed `z` is decided by the same block queries on its `([], [])` decode rather
than rejected (with `a' > 0` and `V` containing the empty-block queries, `[]` itself
is a member).  Exact agreement with `anyVerifier`/`majorityVerifier`/`shiftOrVerifier`
holds on genuine `pairEncode` inputs, which is all `polyTimeModel` consumes; and
since every query to `V` is a *re-encoded* valid pair, membership never depends on
`V`'s values off valid encodings (fill audit round 1, note 3). -/

/-- **`P` is closed under a polynomial block-OR**: if `V ∈ P` then so is the set of
pairs some of whose `a'·(n+1)^k'` blocks of length `a·(n+1)^k` passes `V`'s test,
paired with the first component. -/

    {z : List Bool | ∃ i < a' * ((pairFstD z).length + 1) ^ k',

/-- **`P` is closed under a polynomial block-majority**: if `V ∈ P` then so is the
set of pairs a strict majority of whose `a'·(n+1)^k'` blocks of length `a·(n+1)^k`
passes `V`'s test, paired with the first component. -/
theorem mem_P_of_blockMajority {V : Language Bool} (hV : V ∈ P) (a k a' k' : ℕ) :

(truncating to the shorter word), passes `V`'s test paired with `x`. -/
theorem mem_P_of_blockXorAny {V : Language Bool} (hV : V ∈ P) (a k a' k' : ℕ) :

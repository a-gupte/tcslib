# Universality: every Boolean function is computed by a circuit

[AB09, Claim 2.13], in the form [AB09, p.108] cites it in Chapter 6: every
`f : (Fin n → Bool) → Bool` is computed by a `BoolCircuit.Circuit n` of
explicitly bounded size.

## Main definitions

* `ACP.minterm v` — the `AND` of `n` literals that is true exactly at `v`.
* `ACP.universalCircuit f` — the `OR` of the minterms of `f`'s satisfying
  assignments.

## Main results

* `ACP.universalCircuit_eval` — `universalCircuit f` computes `f`.
* `ACP.universalCircuit_size` — its size is exactly `(n + 1)` times the number
  of satisfying assignments, plus one.
* `ACP.universalCircuit_size_le` — hence at most `2 ^ n * (n + 1) + 1`, a bound
  `ACP.universalCircuit_const_true_size` shows is attained.
* `ACP.exists_circuit_eval_eq_size_le` — the headline existence statement.

## Divergences from [AB09, Claim 2.13]

AB builds the **CNF** `⋀_{v : f v = 0} C_v` over the *falsifying* assignments;
we build the dual **DNF** `⋁_{v : f v = 1} T_v` over the satisfying ones.  Both
are one gate over at most `2ⁿ` gates of `n` literals; only the DNF is formalized
here.

**The constant is ours, not AB's.**  `n2ⁿ` is not an artifact of Chapter 2's
convention — it holds under both of AB's.  On `2ⁿ` clauses of `n` literals,
[AB09, Claim 2.13]'s count of `∧`/`∨` *symbols* is `(n-1)2ⁿ + (2ⁿ-1)`, that is
`n·2ⁿ - 1`; and under [AB09, Def 6.1] the same formula is a fan-in-2 DAG with
`n` shared sources, `n` shared `¬` gates, `(n-1)2ⁿ` binary `∨` and `2ⁿ-1`
binary `∧`, so `n·2ⁿ + 2n - 1` *vertices*.  The `∨` term is AB's own fan-in-2
expansion ([AB09, pp.107–108]: a fan-in-`f` gate becomes `f-1` binary ones),
not a lower bound on what a DAG needs.

`Circuit.size` measures a different object: nodes of an unbounded-fan-in *tree*.
Ours has `n·2ⁿ` literal leaves (nothing is shared, and a sign rides on the leaf
instead of a `¬` gate), `2ⁿ` minterm gates and one top gate — `2 ^ n * (n + 1) + 1`.
The leaves alone already come to within one of AB's whole symbol count, so they
are not what pushes us over; and a `k`-ary gate costs `1` here where AB's fan-in-2 expansion
costs `k-1`, a saving large enough that the net excess over `n·2ⁿ - 1` is only
`2ⁿ + 2`.  Same order as `n2ⁿ`, a larger number, and `2 ^ n * (n + 1) + 1` —
attained at `f ≡ true` — is what is proved here.  [AB09, Ex 6.1]'s sharper
`O(2ⁿ/n)` is a different construction and is not attempted.

## Implementation notes

`Formulas.lean`'s `DNF` is not used as the intermediate: it is built on
`Literal`, a type distinct from `Basic.lean`'s `Lit`; it carries no size measure;
and TCSlib has no `DNF → Circuit` map (`NOrCircuit.toDNF` and `depth2OrToDNF`
both run the other way).  Using it would mean adding both.  `universalCircuit`
is `noncomputable` only because `Finset.toList` is.

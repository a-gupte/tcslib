# Existence of hard Boolean functions

Arora–Barak's counting argument: there are more Boolean functions on `n` bits than
there are small circuits, so some function is computed by none of them.

## Main definitions

None — this file adds only theorems, over `BoolCircuit.Circuit` and `ACP.encodeCircuit`.

## Main results

* `ACP.length_encodeCircuit_succ_le` — a circuit of size `S` on `n` variables has an
  encoding of fewer than `(n + 4) * S` bits.
* `ACP.encodeCircuit_injective` — distinct circuits have distinct encodings.
* `ACP.card_computable_le` — at most `2 ^ ((n + 4) * S)` functions
  `(Fin n → Bool) → Bool` are computed by a circuit of size at most `S`.
* `ACP.exists_not_eval_of_lt` — whenever `(n + 4) * S < 2 ^ n`, some function
  differs from every size-`≤ S` circuit at some input.  [AB09, Thm 6.21]
* `ACP.exists_hard_function` — the same with the explicit size bound
  `2 ^ n / (n + 5)`.  [AB09, Thm 6.21]

## Divergences from [AB09, Thm 6.21]

**AB's size bound `2 ^ n / (10 n)` is not proved here, and the two statements are not
comparable.** [AB09, Def 6.1]'s circuit is a DAG whose `∨`/`∧` gates have fan-in `2`
and whose `¬` gates have fan-in `1`, with size its number of vertices — one source
vertex per input variable, however often that variable is read.
`BoolCircuit.Circuit` is a *tree* with unbounded fan-in and negation folded into its
literals, and `Circuit.size` counts every node. Two effects push our count up: every
literal *occurrence* costs a node, and no gate may be reused. One pushes it down:
`Circuit.size` charges `1` for a `k`-ary gate where Def 6.1 charges `k - 1` vertices.
A size-`S` tree thus embeds in a DAG on at most `S + 2 * n` vertices while no bound
runs the other way, so at the `S ≈ 2 ^ n / n` in play AB's conclusion is strictly the
stronger — but not at every `S`: the three-literal `AND` on `n = 3` has
`Circuit.size = 4`, whereas Def 6.1 needs at least `5` vertices for that function, so
at `S = 4` AB's family is empty and ours is not. Neither comparison is formalized;
both describe the gap to AB, not anything proved below.

The bound proved is `(n + 4) * S < 2 ^ n`, i.e. hardness at size `2 ^ n / (n + 5)`.
It comes from `Encoding.lean`'s serialiser: a leaf costs `idx + 3` bits, its index
being written in unary, and a gate costs three bits plus one per child, so size `S`
fits in fewer than `(n + 4) * S` bits, against the `9 · S · log S` AB cites for an
adjacency list. Since `n + 5 < 10 n` for `n ≥ 1`, `2 ^ n / (n + 5)` is the larger of
the two numbers — a unary index costs `n` bits a leaf, the same order as AB's
`log S ≈ n`, against AB's generous constant `9`. That is not a strengthening of AB: it
is a weaker statement that happens to admit a larger constant. `n + 3` would close for
every `n ≥ 1` — only `n = 0`, where `.node b []` meets `(n + 4) * 1` with equality,
forces the `4` — but carrying `0 < n` through every downstream statement to move the
denominator from `n + 5` to `n + 4` buys nothing.

`n > 1` is not assumed. `(n + 4) * S < 2 ^ n` forces `S = 0` for `n ≤ 2`, and
`Circuit.size` is never `0`, so the conclusion is vacuous there; it first has content
at `n = 3`. AB's own `2 ^ n / (10 n)` is below `1` until `n = 6`.

/-- A circuit of size `S` on `n` variables encodes into fewer than `(n + 4) * S` bits.

**Proof sketch.** Structural induction. A leaf's encoding is a tag bit, a sign bit and
its variable index in unary, so `idx + 3 < n + 4` bits against a size of one. A gate's
encoding is a tag bit, a connective bit and its children block, the block being one
continue bit per child, the children's own encodings, and a stop bit; a side induction
on the list of children shows the block is at most `(n + 4)` times the children's total
size, plus one — each child pays for its own continue bit out of the one bit of slack
the statement carries. The gate's two tag bits, its stop bit and that slack come to
four bits, which is at most the `n + 4` the gate's own node contributes. -/

/-! ## The counting argument -/

/-- At most `2 ^ ((n + 4) * S)` Boolean functions on `n` variables are computed by a
circuit of size at most `S`.  [AB09, Thm 6.21]

**Proof sketch.** Pick, for each function in the set, a circuit of size at most `S`
computing it, and send the function to the number coding that circuit's encoding. The
map is injective on the set: the code determines the bit string, the bit string
determines the circuit, and the circuit determines the function it computes. Its values
lie below `2 ^ ((n + 4) * S)`, because a circuit of size at most `S` encodes into fewer
than `(n + 4) * S` bits. -/

/-- Some Boolean function on `n` variables differs, at some input, from every circuit of
size at most `S`, whenever `(n + 4) * S < 2 ^ n`.  [AB09, Thm 6.21]

**Proof sketch.** There are `2 ^ 2 ^ n` functions on `n` variables and, by
`card_computable_le`, at most `2 ^ ((n + 4) * S)` of them are computed by a circuit of
size at most `S`; the hypothesis makes the second number the smaller, so the computable
ones are not all of them. A function outside that set is computed by no such circuit,
and two Boolean functions that are not equal differ at a point. -/

/-- For every `n` there is a Boolean function on `n` variables that no circuit of size
at most `2 ^ n / (n + 5)` computes.  [AB09, Thm 6.21]

**Proof sketch.** Immediate from `exists_not_eval_of_lt`: if `2 ^ n / (n + 5)` is zero
the hypothesis is `0 < 2 ^ n`, and otherwise multiplying it by `n + 4` rather than
`n + 5` strictly decreases the product, which `n + 5` times the quotient already keeps

/-! Degenerate arities. `Circuit.size` is never `0` and `2 ^ n / (n + 5)` is `0` for
`n ≤ 2`, so `exists_hard_function` says nothing below `n = 3`; at `n = 3` it excludes
every literal and both empty gates. -/
